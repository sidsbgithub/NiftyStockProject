# Nifty DMA Analyzer - Frontend

This directory contains the React frontend for the Nifty DMA Analyzer, built with Vite.

## Functionality
- Displays stock data fetched from the backend API.
- Provides a Dashboard view with sortable and filterable stock overviews.
- Offers a detailed Stock Detail page with:
    - Market snapshot and DMA analysis.
    - Interactive price charts (Candlestick, SMAs, Volume) using Chart.js.
    - Key metrics get_stock_detail(ticker_symbol):
    print(f"\n--- Requesting EXTENDED detail for {ticker_symbol} ---")
    # ... (cache check logic) ...
    # ... (base_stock_data fetching) ...
    
    stock_obj = yf.Ticker(ticker_symbol)
    stock_info_obj = {} 
    financials_annual, financials_quarterly, balance_sheet_annual, balance_sheet_quarterly, cash_flow_annual, cash_flow_quarterly = None, None, None, None, None, None
    # news_data_list = [] # REMOVED or ensure it's always empty if key exists in payload
    historical_data_for_chart, dma_signals_historical = [], [] 

    try: 
        stock_info_obj = stock_obj.info
        if not stock_info_obj: 
            print(f"  WARN: stock.info was empty for {ticker_symbol}.")
            stock_info_obj = {} 
        
        try: # Financials
            financials_annual =, financial ratios, and financial statement tables.
